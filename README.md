## Performance âš¡

csvmd is built for speed and efficiency. Here are some benchmarks showing processing times for various scenarios:

### Real-world Data Processing

| Dataset | Rows | Input Size | Processing Time | Memory Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Employee Records | 1,000 | 71KB | 4ms | 3MB |
| Employee Records | 10,000 | 731KB | 10ms | 8MB |
| Employee Records | 100,000 | 7MB | 150ms | 66MB |
| Employee Records | 200,000 | 13MB | 180ms | ~100MB |

### Complex Data with Special Characters

csvmd handles complex CSV data efficiently, including:
- Quoted fields with embedded commas
- Multi-line content with newlines  
- Pipe characters (`|`) that need escaping
- Unicode characters

| Dataset | Rows | Input Size | Processing Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Complex Data | 1,000 | 147KB | 4ms |
| Complex Data | 10,000 | 1MB | 12ms |

### Streaming Mode Benefits

For large files, use `--stream` to process data with constant memory usage:

- **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming mode uses constant memory regardless of file size
- **Immediate Output**: Results appear as soon as processing begins
- **Large File Support**: Handle files larger than available RAM

```bash
# Process a 100MB file with constant ~10MB memory usage
csvmd --stream huge_dataset.csv > output.md
```
