# csvmd

Convert a CSV file to a Markdown table ðŸ“Š

```bash
# Convert a file on disk
csvmd input.csv > output.md

# Convert a file passed to stdin
cat input.csv | csvmd > output.md
```

## Performance

csvmd is designed for high performance with both small and large CSV files. Here are benchmark results from real-world testing:

### Processing Speed

| File Size | Standard Mode | Streaming Mode | Throughput |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| 100 rows Ã— 5 cols | 94 Î¼s | 112 Î¼s | ~51 MB/s |
| 1,000 rows Ã— 5 cols | 802 Î¼s | 831 Î¼s | ~65 MB/s |
| 10,000 rows Ã— 5 cols | 7.96 ms | 7.9 ms | ~71 MB/s |

### Memory Usage

csvmd has excellent memory efficiency:

- **Memory overhead**: Only ~19% increase from input to output size
- **1,000 rows**: 53 KB â†’ 65 KB (1.22x)
- **100,000 rows**: 6.3 MB â†’ 7.5 MB (1.19x)

### Column Scaling Performance

Performance scales well with increasing column counts:

| Columns | Processing Time | Throughput |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| 5 columns | 798 Î¼s | ~65 MB/s |
| 10 columns | 1.43 ms | ~73 MB/s |
| 20 columns | 2.78 ms | ~79 MB/s |
| 50 columns | 6.32 ms | ~88 MB/s |

### Complex Data Handling

Even with complex CSV features (escaped pipes, embedded newlines, quotes), performance remains excellent:

- **100 rows**: 89 Î¼s (~66 MB/s)
- **1,000 rows**: 771 Î¼s (~79 MB/s)  
- **5,000 rows**: 3.79 ms (~82 MB/s)

### Mode Comparison

- **Standard mode**: Best for smaller files (< 10MB), loads entire CSV into memory
- **Streaming mode**: Better for very large files, uses two-pass approach with minimal memory usage
- **Trade-off**: Streaming mode has ~19% overhead for small files, but performs similarly or better for larger files

All benchmarks performed on a modern Apple Silicon Mac. Performance will vary based on hardware and specific CSV characteristics.
