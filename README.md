## Usage

```
Convert CSV to Markdown table

Usage: csvmd [OPTIONS] [FILE]

Arguments:
  [FILE]  Input CSV file (if not provided, reads from stdin)

Options:
  -d, --delimiter <DELIMITER>  CSV delimiter character [default: ,]
      --no-headers             Treat first row as data, not headers
      --stream                 Use streaming mode for large files (writes output immediately)
      --align <ALIGN>          Header alignment: left, center, or right [default: left]
  -h, --help                   Print help
  -V, --version                Print version
```

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Basic usage with left-aligned headers (default)
csvmd data.csv

# Center-aligned headers for better readability
csvmd --align center data.csv

# Right-aligned headers for numeric data
csvmd --align right financial_data.csv

# Combined with other options
csvmd --delimiter ";" --align center --no-headers data.csv

# Streaming mode with alignment for large files
csvmd --stream --align center large_dataset.csv
```

## Performance âš¡

csvmd is built for speed and efficiency. Here are some benchmarks showing processing times for various scenarios:

### Real-world Data Processing

| Dataset | Rows | Input Size | Processing Time | Memory Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Employee Records | 1,000 | 71KB | 4ms | 3MB |
| Employee Records | 10,000 | 731KB | 10ms | 8MB |
| Employee Records | 100,000 | 7MB | 150ms | 66MB |
| Employee Records | 200,000 | 13MB | 180ms | ~100MB |

### Complex Data with Special Characters

csvmd handles complex CSV data efficiently, including:
- Quoted fields with embedded commas
- Multi-line content with newlines  
- Pipe characters (`|`) that need escaping
- Unicode characters

| Dataset | Rows | Input Size | Processing Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Complex Data | 1,000 | 147KB | 4ms |
| Complex Data | 10,000 | 1MB | 12ms |

### Streaming Mode

The `--stream` flag writes output rows directly instead of building a large in-memory string. Behavior differs by input source:

- **File input (seekable)**: Does not buffer the entire file in memory. Performs two passes by rewinding the file: the first pass computes the maximum column count; the second pass writes the Markdown table. Output memory remains bounded because rows are written as they are processed.
- **Stdin/pipe (non-seekable)**: Buffers the entire input first to determine the maximum column count, then streams the output. This still reduces peak memory versus the default mode because the full Markdown output is not stored in memory, but it cannot process inputs larger than available RAM.
- **Two-pass processing**: In both cases, output begins after the first pass completes to ensure correct column widths and header separator formatting.

Examples:

```bash
# File input: two passes without buffering the whole file in memory
csvmd --stream data.csv > output.md

# Piped input: buffers input, then streams output
cat data.csv | csvmd --stream > output.md

# With custom alignment
csvmd --stream --align center data.csv > output.md
```
